# simplestate-demo
A small app to demonstrate the use of the simplestate gem. 

This uses the metaphore of an elevator controller to demonstrate the use of the simplestate gem. It is a work in progress. I will try to update it as other projects permit. My intent is that it should always be a functional app.

####Usage:

  Clone the app: ```git clone https://github.com/dpneumo/simplestate-demo.git otis```
  
  cd into it: ```cd otis```
  
  Run bundle: ```bundle install```
  
  Run the app: ```bundle exec ruby lib/runner.rb```
